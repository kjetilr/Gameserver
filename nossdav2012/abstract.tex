Supporting thousands of interacting players in a virtual world poses
huge challenges with respect to processing. To host as many
players as possible, the server software has
to implement support for massive parallelism. Earlier work within the
field suggests that this is difficult due to synchronization issues, but
in this paper, we present the design and implementation of a game server
architecture based on a model that allows for massive parallelism.
%The server design is evaluated using
%replayed traces from actual gameplay to create server traffic. 
%We also discuss challenges that arise as different
%dependency requirements are introduced to the system. 
Our prototype is evaluated using traces from live game sessions where
we measure the server response time for all objects that need timely
updates. We also measure how the response time for the multi-threaded
implementation varies with the number of threads used. Our results
show that the challenge of scaling up a game-server can be an
embarrassingly parallel problem.
