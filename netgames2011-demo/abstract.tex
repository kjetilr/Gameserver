Games where thousands of players can interact concurrently pose many
challenges with regards to the massive parallelism. Earlier work
within the field suggests that this is difficult due to
synchronization issues. In this paper, we present an implementation
of a game server architecture based on a model that allows for
massive parallelism. The system is evaluated using traces from live
game sessions that has been scaled up to generate massive workloads.
We measure the differences in server response time for all objects
that need timely updates. We also measure how the response time for
the multithreaded implementation varies with the number of threads
used. Our results show that the case of implementing a game-server
can actually be highly parallel problem.
